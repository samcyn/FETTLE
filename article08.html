                            <h3>Depression: A Global Crisis</h3>
                            <p style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">"According to WHO, Mental health is "a state of well-being in which the individual realizes his or her own abilities, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work productively and fruitfully, and is able to make a contribution to his or her community". WHO stresses that mental health "is not just the absence of mental disorder". Mental health problem can happen to anyone at some point, which can affect his/her daily life, relationships or physical health."</p>

                            <h3 style="margin-bottom: 0px;">Why Mental Health is important.</h3>
                            <ul>
                                <li> Mental health  causes a heavy burden </li>
                                <li> Mental health impedes the achievement of other health and development targets</li>
                                <li> Mental health contributes to poverty and differentially affects the poor</li>
                                <li> Mental health has intrinsic value as does physical health</li>
                            </ul><br>

                            <h3 style="margin-bottom: 0px;">INTRODUCTION</h3>
                            <p>Depression is a common mental disorder affecting more than 350 million people of all ages, in all communities, and is a significant contributor to the global burden of disease . It presents with depressed mood, loss of interest or pleasure, feelings of guilt or low self-worth, disturbed sleep or appetite, low energy, and poor concentration. These problems can become chronic or recurrent and lead to substantial impairments in an individual's ability to take care of his or her everyday responsibilities. At its worst, depression can lead to suicide, a tragic fatality associated with the loss of about 850 000 lives every year. </p>

                            <h3 style="margin-bottom: 0px;">Depression - the Burden</h3>
                            <p>Depression is the leading cause of disability as measured by years lived with disability (YLDs) and the 4th leading contributor to the global burden of disease in 2000. By the year 2020, depression is projected to reach 2nd place of the ranking of disability adjusted life years (DALYs) calculated for all ages, both sexes. Today, depression is already the 2nd cause of DALYs in the age category 15-44 years for both sexes combined and this group make up the majority of employees in any organization. Depression occurs in persons of all genders, ages, and backgrounds.(W.H.O,2011)</p>

                            <p>In developing countries like Nigeria, the prevalence rates of depression are higher because environmental factors that contribute to the genesis of depressive disorders are more preponderant. These include high rates of poverty, a lack of social welfare and high rates of endemic infectious diseases, to mention just a few. Also, depression tends to be masked in Africans by somatic symptoms, which may explain why it is under diagnosed or underrecognised. Prevalence rates vary from 11% to 60%. Higher rates are observed depending on study setting (clinical v. community), assessment tool (self-report questionnaire v. diagnostic tool) and design (uncontrolled v. controlled).</p>
                            <p>In Nigeria, depression is much higher in the elderly with female more than the male.</p>
                            <p>Death from suicide is common </p>

                                <li>Most people who commit suicide show severe symptoms of depression
                                    <ul>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Biochemistry: Deficiencies in two chemicals in the brain (serotonin and norepinephrine) are thought to be responsible for certain symptoms of depression, including anxiety, irritability, and fatigue.</li>
                                <li>Genetics:  Depression can run in families.  For example, if one identical twin has depression, the other twin has a 70% chance of also having the illness during their lifetime.</li>
                                <li> Environmental and Other Stressors: Significant loss, a difficult relationship, financial problems or a major life change are often cited as contributors to depression.  Continuous exposure to violence, neglect, abuse, or poverty may make people more vulnerable to depression.</li>
                                <li>Physiological: Sometimes the onset of depression is associated with, or a symptom of, an acute or chronic physical illness, such as stroke, diabetes, heart attack.  It can be a side effect of medication or a symptom of drug or alcohol abuse.  Depression can be the result of dieting or a hormonal change in females.</li>
                                <li>Personality:  People with low self-esteem, who are easily overwhelmed by stress, have a tendency to worry excessively or who are generally pessimistic, appear to be especially vulnerable to depression.</li>
