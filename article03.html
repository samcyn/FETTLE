                            <h3 style="margin-bottom: 0px;">WHO WE ARE!!!!</h3>
                            <p>SPEAKOUT INITIATIVE (SOI) is Nigeria’s leading mental health advocacy organization. We are families of loved ones who have struggled with these issues, or been lost to suicide. We are advocates who see mental health as a public health and social justice issue. We are mental health care professionals who believe that an individual’s goals for recovery should come first. </p>
                            <p>We want to remind everyone about the facts we are facing and how all of us can help more Nigerians get the psychological, behavioural, mental health and substance use disorder services they need.</p>

                            <h3 style="margin-bottom: 0px;">DID YOU KNOW???</h3>
                            <ul>
                                <li>1 in 4 Nigerians have a behavioral health (mental health or substance use disorder) condition </li>
                                <li>Studies in Nigeria have revealed prevalence rates of about 20-28% for diagnosable psychiatric conditions in the general population. This means that there are, at least, 25 million people who would benefit from mental health services in Nigeria. </li>
                                <li>The cost of untreated mental illness to the Nigerian economy is estimated to run into billions of naira every year. Stigma remains a serious problem, with many cases of human rights violations, such as, chaining or beating, experienced by people with mental illness.</li>
                                <li>Only about 160 qualified Psychiatrists for a 160million Nigerians, this means 1 per 1million as compared 1 per 10 thousand in the UK. There are more Nigerian Psychiatrists in the UK than in Nigeria.</li>
                                <li>1 Psychiatric nurse per 50 thousand Nigerians</li>
                                <li>0.02 Clinical Psychologist per 160 thousand Nigerians </li>
                                <li>Less than 3% of Gross Domestics Product is budgeted to health and less than 1 % goes to mental health.</li>
                                <li>The Lunacy Act of 1958 is what it’s in use in Nigeria because the Mental Health bill has not been passed by the National Assembly.</li>
                                <li>The social stigma associated with a mental health diagnosis is the leading cause of individuals—especially men—refusing to seek help with their issues.</li>
                            </ul><br>

                            <h3 style="margin-bottom: 0px;">WHAT YOU CAN DO TO HELP?</h3>
                            <h4>The most important thing we can do is remind people that mental health is health, not a separate issue about which we should be ashamed of.</h4>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Don't label people. For example, instead of saying "the mentally ill," say "people with mental health conditions."</li>
                                <li>Do not equate mental health conditions with violence or antisocial behavior (according to researches, only about 5% of violent crimes are committed by individuals with a mental health diagnosis).</li>
                                <li>Share your personal experiences on mental health issues, its healthy.</li>
                                <li>Encourage friends and family members to share their experiences.</li>
                                <li>Incorporate mental health into your regular health check-ups, just like going to the dentist.</li>
                                <li>Remember that our mental health IS our health, not a separate category.</li>
                            </ul><br><br>
